Git is a **version control system**, this allows programmers to keep track of
changes in their code.

The benefit of this is that if you make changes that break functionality, you
can easily go back to a previous version. It also allows for developing multiple
things at once using a feature called **branches** and incorporating them into
the main code when the feature is ready.

While there are other version control systems, git is by far the most popular,
particularly in open source projects. It has been popularised by the git hosting
services [GitHub](https://github.com/) and [GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/).

Anything can be tracked in a git, but it is best for text files, as the changes
to them are small. Using it for other things such as images does not being the
same benefits as the changes are not as simple.
