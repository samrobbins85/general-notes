title: "Tables in Markdown"

Tables in markdown have a much nicer syntax than in HTML, allowing them to be
more easily interpreted

The distinction between cells is created using the vertical bar symbol `|`
dashes are also used to separate the header

```md
| Heading 1 | Heading 2 |
| --------- | --------- |
| Cell 1    | Cell 2    |
```

This translates to the table:

| Heading 1 | Heading 2 |
| --------- | --------- |
| Cell 1    | Cell 2    |
