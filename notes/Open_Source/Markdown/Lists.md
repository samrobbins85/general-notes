Lists can be written basically as you would type it out. Bullets can be written
with either a start `*` or dash `-`

```md
-   This
-   Is
-   An
-   Unordered
-   List
```

For ordered lists, just start with numbers:

```md
1. This
2. Is
3. An
4. Ordered
5. List
```

List with checkboxes.

For a checked box, use `- [x]` and for an unchecked box, use `- [ ]`

```md
- [x] Checked 
- [x] Box 
- [x] Example
- [ ] Unchecked 
- [ ] Box 
- [ ] Example
```
