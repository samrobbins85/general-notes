title: "Introduction to Markdown"
---

Markdown is a **markup language** in the same way that HTML is, allowing for
dictating content structure.

The advantage of markdown is that it has a much simpler syntax when compared to
HTML, which we will go through in ths guide.

Markdown also provides a subset of the features of HTML, meaning that markdown
can be translated to HTML.

For this reason, it is extensively used in documentation websites as they don't
require complicated layouts. Some examples of this is the
[Next.js documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/getting-started),
[Gatsby documentation](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/), and many more, including
this website.

Contributing to documentation is a great way to get started with open source as
it doesn't require in depth knowledge of the codebase and can even be done
directly in the GitHub website.

As well as in documentation, Markdown is used for README files, so whenever you
see one of these in an open source project, it is made using Markdown.

The file extension for markdown files is `.md`. You may also see files with the
extension `.mdx`, such as the ones for this site, this is a superset of
markdown, so you can use markdown inside it. I may also explain what you can do
with `.mdx` in more advanced versions of this guide.
