title: "Links and Images in Markdown"
---

# Links

Links in markdown are inserted using the following syntax

```md
[alt](https://google.com)
```

The first parameter is mapped to the `alt` attribute in HTML and the second is
mapped to the `href` attribute

# Images

Images use a very similar syntax, but with an exclamation point in front:

```md
![alt](https://example.com/image.png)
```
