title: "Forking and Pull Requests"
---

The first step in contributing to an open source project is to **fork** it. This
means to create a copy of the repository in your account. Once you do this, you
can then make whatever changes you feel are appropriate. You can see which of
your repositories are forks as they come with a note under the title (red added
by me):

![Forked Repo](/img/learn_contribute/github/fork/Forked_Repo.webp)

A **pull request** is a request from the forked repository back to the original
repository to add the improvements. You can easily create a pull request from
any branch back to the original repository, as they will have this banner above
the code, and you can click **Pull Request** to start one

After doing this, you need to describe what your pull request does. Many large
projects will have a template for pull requests, and the contents of that will
be filled out already for you. You should edit this to describe your particular
change, this allows the maintainers to better understand what your pull request
does and why it is needed. If your problem is solving a certain issue, you
should also mention that in your pull request.
