title: Using Lists in HTML
---

There are two main types of lists in HTML, ordered and unordered. An ordered
list uses numbers or another method of showing the items are ordered, whereas an
unordered list will use bullet points.

## Ordered List

An ordered list looks like this

1. Three
2. Ordered
3. Items

It is implemented using the `ol` tag. List items are implemented using the `li`
tag. So the above list looks like this in HTML:

```html
<ol>
	<li>Three</li>
	<li>Ordered</li>
	<li>Items</li>
</ol>
```

## Unordered list

An unordered list looks like this:

-   Three
-   Unordered
-   Items

It is implemented using the `ul` tag. Again list items are implemented using the
`li` tag. Meaning the above list looks like this in HTML

```html
<ul>
	<li>Three</li>
	<li>Unordered</li>
	<li>Items</li>
</ul>
```
