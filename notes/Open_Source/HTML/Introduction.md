HTML determines the content of a webpage, and is a standard shared across all
browsers.

# Tags

Tags in HTML are used structure the content in a webpage. They are denoted using
less than and greater than symbols, such as `<html>`. These symbols are
sometimes called **angle brackets** as they act as brackets around the content.

Tags that are opened should also be closed. This is done with the same tag, but
with a slash immediately after the less than sign.

```HTML
<html>
<!-- Content inside the tag -->
</html>
```

Some tags don't need closing, and we will get into those later

## Tag Attributes

Opening tags can also have attributes, an example of this is the `<html>` tag,
this has a `lang` attribute

```HTML
<html lang="">
<!-- Content inside the tag -->
</html>
```

The most common uses of attributes are `style` and `class`, which we will get
into later
